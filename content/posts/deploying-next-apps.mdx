Math is often derided by the adult population, as a skillset that is rarely applicable in their everyday lives.

There are several arguments from the math literate community in rebuttle:
1. Learning math teaches structured thinking skills required for a number of everyday and work tasks.
2. Teaching math to all is required because those that survive the process go on to become math literate professionals: engineers, doctors, scientists, programmers, etc. A gap in the math education of these people would prohibit them from learning it at all.
3. Math is fun. All must have fun!

English as a subject is rarely interrogated to the same extent. 
What generalisable skills does it teach? And what can we learn from our attitudes about English, that could be applied to Math.
Why do we formally learn a language that we are native in?

The core components of learning english, spelling, grammar, and vocabulary (i.e. literacy), we learn mostly before age 10.
